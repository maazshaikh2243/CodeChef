Overview
This project contains Java source code files that solve various programming challenges, implement specific algorithms, or build small applications. Each file is a self-contained Java program, designed for educational purposes, practice, or competitive programming.

Features
Java-based solutions: Each file is implemented in Java, taking advantage of the language's capabilities for problem-solving.
Stand-alone programs: Most files can be run independently, allowing for modular testing and usage.
Reusable template: This README template is designed for any Java file, making it easy to document multiple Java programs in one repository.
Requirements
To run these Java programs, you’ll need the following:

Java Development Kit (JDK), version 8 or later.
To confirm the Java version on your machine, use:

bash
Copy code
java -version
File Structure
Each Java file is self-contained and can be compiled and executed independently. The main files in this repository are organized as follows:

bash
Copy code
/ProjectRoot
│
├── README.md              # Project documentation
├── YourJavaFile1.java     # Example Java file
├── YourJavaFile2.java     # Another example Java file
└── ...
Setup and Installation
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Ensure that the Java Development Kit (JDK) is installed and properly set up in your environment.
Navigate to the directory containing the Java files you want to run.
Usage
To run any Java file:

Compile the Java Program
In your terminal, navigate to the file's directory and compile it using:

bash
Copy code
javac YourJavaFile.java
Run the Compiled Program
After compilation, you can execute the program with:

bash
Copy code
java YourJavaFile
Input and Output

Each program may prompt for input. Follow the prompts to provide necessary input.
The program will then display output based on the problem requirements or implementation logic.
Example
For example, to run a file called SampleProgram.java:

bash
Copy code
javac SampleProgram.java
java SampleProgram
# Follow any input prompts
Troubleshooting
If you encounter errors during compilation or runtime:

Ensure that the file name matches the class name (Java is case-sensitive).
Verify that you’re using a compatible JDK version.
Check that the code syntax matches the Java version you are using.
